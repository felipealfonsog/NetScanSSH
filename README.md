# NetScanSSH
NetScanSSH is a versatile Python tool designed to facilitate network administrators or security analysts in identifying and managing devices within their local network environment. By leveraging ARP scanning techniques, the script swiftly detects active devices, filtering out those with open SSH ports. Upon discovery, it retrieves the hostname associated with each device's IP address, providing comprehensive insights into network topology. With its intuitive interface and rapid execution, NetScanSSH empowers users to streamline network reconnaissance tasks, enhancing overall network security and management efficiency.


<sub>* This is currently an experimental phase where the primary focus is on making the system functional and establishing a practical and logical pathway that aligns with both my vision and the project's goals. It might contain errors, bugs, etc. Many other non-core elements of the project are considered secondary.</sub>
